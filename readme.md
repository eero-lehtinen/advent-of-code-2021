# Advent of Code 2021
Days 1-9 are in Haskell.

The rest are in Rust.

## Haskell run instructions
Developed with GHC 9.4.2 and Cabal 3.6.2.0 (installed with [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/))
```sh
cd 01
cabal run part1
cabal run part2
```

## Rust run instructions
Developed with rustc 1.63.0, should work with all later and most earlier versions (installed with [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install))
```sh
cd 10
cargo run --release --bin part1
cargo run --release --bin part2
```
